# kiwiholiday-version1.0
Final project of web development.

A third party holiday house rental platform.

Main language-PHP,JS,HTML,CSS.
Database-MySQL.

WEB APP function--registration, login, booking, displaying, rating, making payment, visitor management, property management.

Please see flowchart to get design logic.



Please note that:
When a host hosted a house, the house status is “pending”, an admin staff has to change the status to “listed” so that the house can be listed at front end.

When a guest make booking, the booking status is ‘booked’, in this stage the host can not get booking until the guest confirm the booking by completing guest detail of booking.

Rating and review can only be done when the booking is completed, that means the host already clicked the “charge fee” button and complete the booking on his side.

Operation buttons are variable due to different status of bookings and houses. Such as: a guest can only see the “rating” button when the booking complete.
